Note: Assumes you have max level lightning and earthquake spells for your town hall level and that you have
access to max level donation spells for your town hall level.


## Future Ideas

 - Always include 1 non-cc option or ability to disable CC in calcs. Useful if taking out 2 sets of air ds.
 - Get some graphics in (e.g. army screen from in game)
 - Show how much damage done by each spell (useful for EQs)
 - Have a tool to put in an arbitrary set of spells to see total damage (able to explore some double eq options)
 - Use town halls as presets and have individual configurable spell levels
 - Show town hall level next to air defs
 - Add other structures (i.e. sweepers and infernos)
 - Ability to add another defence which is reachable by an EQ
